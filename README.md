## History
This tool has been originally created to support touch rugby tournaments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_%28sport%29) since 
there is no online platform which collect and mantains tour rugby tournaments data. At the moment I am extending the application to support paddel-tennis tournaments and
offers a database of padder-tennis tournaments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padel_%28sport%29).
